# Club Ignition
Push button start for a night club using a Raspberry Pi Zero and two arcade buttons.

Two arcade buttons were wired to GPIO pins 17 and 27 with a 6k resistor in line with each. Pressing and holding a button for 3 seconds triggers the function connected. Time delay is to prevent any unnecessary triggers.
